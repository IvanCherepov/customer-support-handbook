## Ticketing {#docs-internal-guid-230b5471-d855-0961-d284-a4f28a124be2}

We use Zendesk \([https://coreos.zendesk.com](https://coreos.zendesk.com)\) for our ticketing system.

Our internal users within the ticketing system are called agents. Zendesk allows us to track all correspondence with our users in a support capacity.  Zendesk also provides analytics so that we can group requests by product, see who our most active support customers are, and get averages on response times.

## Chat {#docs-internal-guid-70e44e3a-d855-3060-388c-9dbbb48161f1}

There are three primary chat systems in use at CoreOS: IRC, Slack and Chatlio. For community based support we use the channel\#coreos on the IRC network Freenode. This provides us a place where we can collaborate with community contributors/developers, answer questions from users, and share information about the direction of our various projects. There is a public facing log of all chat messages \([https://botbot.me/freenode/coreos/](https://botbot.me/freenode/coreos/\)\). Remember! ALL messages are logged. We all like kidding around, but if there is something that could be construed as embarrassing, insulting, or downright rude itâ€™s probably best to not say it in a place that will be logged in perpetuity.  We have a CoreOS team on IRCCloud\(https://www.irccloud.com/\) which grants unlimited access.

The second chat system in use is Slack \([https://coreos.slack.com/](https://coreos.slack.com/)\). Slack is used for all internal communications and is the best way to get a question quickly answered by another staff member. All mesages are retained for 60 days only. 

Chatlio\(https://chatlio.com/\) is our live chat system for Quay.io. It allows to chat with visitors directly from Slack.
