### Ticketing system

We use [Zendesk](https://coreos.zendesk.com) as our ticketing system.

Our internal users within the ticketing system are called agents. Zendesk allows us to track all correspondence with our users in a support capacity.  Zendesk also provides analytics so that we can group requests by product, see who our most active support customers are, and get averages on response times.

### Chat

There are three primary chat systems in use at CoreOS: IRC, Slack and Chatlio.

For community-based support we use the channel\#coreos on the IRC network Freenode. This provides us a place where we can collaborate with community contributors/developers, answer questions from users, and share information about the direction of our various projects. There is a [public facing log](https://botbot.me/freenode/coreos/) of all chat messages Remember! ALL messages are logged. We all like kidding around, but if there is something that could be construed as embarrassing, insulting, or downright rude itâ€™s probably best to not say it in a place that will be logged in perpetuity.  We have a CoreOS team on [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/) which grants unlimited access.

The second chat system in use is [Slack](https://coreos.slack.com/). Slack is used for all internal communications and is the best way to get a question quickly answered by another staff member. All messages are retained for 60 days only.

[Chatlio](https://chatlio.com/) is our live chat system for Quay.io. It allows chatting with visitors directly from Slack.

### Online meetings

We use Google Hangouts for online meetings.
