## Team member is unavailable {#not-available}

### Vacation {#vacation}

 There are some things to consider when a member of the support team takes a vacation.

**On-call schedule must be covered**

Before leaving for vacation, 2 weeks before at the latest, you should coordinate with your colleagues to see who can take over the days when you should be on-call.  

**Rest of the team**

At any point in time at least half of the support team must be available to handle all our tasks, so be sure to let everyone know about your plans as soon as you know something. This can be done in the Google Calendar. Vacation days are first come first served.

**Tickets assigned to you**

As a courtesy to other team members, please try to address all "Open" tickets \(awaiting a response from the customer\) in your queue.

### Illness {#illness}

You should always take care of yourself and make sure you are healthy. If you need to take a sick day, let your team members know. If there is an important ticket pending, ask one of your colleagues to help you if you foresee that you will be unavailable for more than 1 day.

If you are on-call but ill, ask one of your colleagues to cover for you.

### Unforeseen events {#unforeseen-events}

If you need to take care of something urgent, there is no need to ask for permission. Just notify the team via the \#support channel in Slack. If you are on-call, ask one of your colleagues to cover for you.
