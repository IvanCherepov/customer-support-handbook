\[Work in Progress\]

Macros and Triggers:

* Escalate ticket
  * 
* Page on-call engineer
  * Calls engineer in an urgent situation
* ‘Follow the Sun’
  * handoff tickets to off-hours L1 support for updates. A typical example on this would be for long running tasks or issues that just require \`check-ins’ from them and/or monitoring.
