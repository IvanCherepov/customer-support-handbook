As members of the support team we are the first to interact with someone when they have a problem or question. As such it is up to us to represent the company and make sure we present ourselves properly. Therefore we are expected to:

* Always be friendly and respectful.
* Be open to new ideas and points of view.
* It is OK if you don't know something. You can always ask someone else.
* It is OK to say no to a customer, but try to suggest a workaround and escalate to a Senior if necessary.
