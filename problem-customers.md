# Problem customers {#docs-internal-guid-312d65e4-d859-5337-c346-d20a3125d449}

General rules in dealing with irritated customers:

* Allow the customer to vent

* Always use gentle language

* Don't take it personally

* Take a deep breath or a short walk before reply

Jordan Sissel of the Logstash project coined the phrase: “If a newbie has a bad time, it’s a bug.”While not all of our customers will have a totally smooth experience we can still strive to deliver one that isn’t painful. Frustrated customers are a fact of life in the world of customer service and support. Often angry customers are less an issue of the product their opening a support issue about and more a product of the rest of their day. If someone is having a bad day and etcd loses quorum due to a bug or CoreOS reboots because a customer missed the documentation on locksmith this could just be the final straw which causes an explosion.

The National Alliance on Mental Illness has a wonderful process for working with individuals in crisis. We do not want to imply that any of our customers are mentally ill, only that the LEAP \([http://naminc.org/nn/blet/bunc-de-escalation.ppt](http://naminc.org/nn/blet/bunc-de-escalation.ppt\)\) strategy for de-escalation is a wonderful tool for calming individuals.

* Listen

* Empathize

* Affirm

* Partner

One thing to note is that de-escalation doesn’t always work. If that is the case don’t hesitate to contact someone else in the organization for help. While our goal is to give our customers a more positive experience we don’t want to do that at the expense of our own employees.

These steps do not need to be taken in this exact order \(or even all of the steps in every case\). The goal is to have a toolset to guide interactions to ensure that everyone is satisfied with the outcome.

Empathizing is the idea that we can step into our customers' shoes and visualize what it’s like to be in their shoes. This doesn’t mean that we have to apologize or feel sorry for them, merely that we are attempting to see things from their perspective. Partnering is the process of working with the customer to affect the outcome. Often a customer will contact support asking to be spoonfed the answer. This doesn’t help the customer and will only have them contacting support again if a similar issue arises. Something as simple as requesting information about their desired outcome can short circuit some of the processes. For example, given a customer who wants to set up a four node etcd cluster with two nodes on the east coast and two nodes on the west coast

While it seems obvious, listening to our customers and letting them know we are listening is one of the most basic parts of technical support. Listening to the customer and letting them know when things aren’t their fault is one fantastic strategy for calming them.

“That’s totally a bug and it’s not your fault.”

Informing the customer that what happened was beyond their control removes any stigma or perceived failings they have.

This will then make them more open to working with you and finding a resolution.
