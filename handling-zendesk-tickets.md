**Assiginng a ticket**

Assign a ticket to yourself the moment you decide you are going to work on it. If the nature of the problem requires you to investigate further, let the customer know that you need further time to investigate, assign the ticket to yourself, and submit the reply. By assigning the ticket to yourself you are letting your team members know that you will work with this customer and by replying to the customer, even if you need further time to craft a proper answer, you are acknowledging their request.

**Point to documentation**

As a general rule, you should always include a link to the applicable documentation as part of your response to a ticket. If the documentation does not exist yet, then _make_ the documentation and send the link in the response. For those situations where making documentation is a more time consuming exercise.

**Create issues**

During your interaction with the customers you will most likely need to create or update an issue, either for a feature request, for a bug, or for further documentation. Since we do everything in the open, it is good practice to send the link of the issue to the requesting customer, so that they can also keep an eye on the discussion there, and weigh in if necessary.

**After the first response**

In most cases when you reply to a customer you expect a reply back. In this case the ticket should be marked as `Pending`. If this ticket doesn't receive a reply within 7 days, you should follow up with the customer. If this is your second response without a reply you can mark the ticket as solved at this point, otherwise ask them if they still need help or have further questions.

When a feature request or the fix for a bug has been scheduled for a future release, you should let the customer know about the version for which this has been scheduled and when that version is going to be releases, e.g. June 22nd for 8.9, and add the `promised` tag to the ZenDesk ticket.

Sometimes a customer will send an email to ask for a response to an issue that was already created on a public issue tracker. In such cases, include the link to the given issue in the "GitLab Issue" box, go ahead and reply from the issue tracker, but also follow-up through ZenDesk by providing a link to your comment in the issue tracker. Providing the response to the customer is what sets the "first response time" metric, and allows the tickets to be closed when appropriate.

**When and how to escalate a ticket?**

Do not hesitate to ask for help with a ticket, you can ask any of your colleagues to assist you. You can do this via Slack initially by [@mentioning](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205240127-Using-mentions) their name and providing a link to the description with an overview of the issue. If the person you know can help you the best \(expert on a specific topic\) is not available on Slack, you can assign the ticket to them, add a comment summarizing the situation, and submit the ticket as **open**. Especially if you do are not yet fully familiar with the particular topic of the issue, don't spend more than 30 minutes on an issue before escalating it internally.

**When to mark a ticket as solved?**

A ticket can be marked as solved when you are certain that you were able to resolve the requester's problem, or, as mentioned above, when many days go by without a reply from the requester. The exception to this rule is in social media support channels that do not integrate well with ZenDesk such as Disqus, the Forum, Stack Overflow, and others, where each comment creates a new ticket. In those cases, you can close the ticket as soon as you have provided a response \(and also close the ticket created by your own response\).

**Clearing out Suspended Tickets**

In ZenDesk, various filters send a ticket straight to "suspended" status. This is mostly useful to remove spam and it works quite well. However, it is possible that actual tickets are accidentally routed to Suspended Tickets, so it is important to check the new Suspended Ticket queue at least once a day. Doing this on a regular basis also keeps that queue manageable.

**Allowing teammates to adopt a ticket**

When you are viewing a ticket teammates see an eye icon on the left of the ticket in the Views Screen.

This implies that you're reading or working on the ticket so if your not going to handle it make sure to close it by closing the tab at the upper section of the screen that has the ticket's title.

If you see a ticket with this icon that either you feel you can add value to it, or has been open for too long then please ask your teammate through Slack if he or she is still working on it. The person's name appears by hovering over the, ticket's title on the list view or by selecting the ticket and reading the "Also on this ticket" section on the top left. Notice that if a general account like GitLab Support is being used there is no name to refer to so you might want to ask on the support and/or general chat channel with the ticket's link.ze
