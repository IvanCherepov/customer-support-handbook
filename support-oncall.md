## Support On-Call 

We use [PagerDuty](http://gitlab.pagerduty.com/) to set the on-call schedules, and to route notifications to the correct on-call support engineer. There is one rotation for CoreOS Customer Support and there is (currently) no secondary. 

### Expectations for Support On-Call

- If you are on call, then you are expected to be available and ready to respond to PagerDuty pings and Customer Support Calls as soon as possible, but certainly within any response times set by our Service Level Agreements in the case of Customer Emergencies. This may require bringing a laptop and reliable internet connection with you if you have plans outside of your work space while being on call, as an example.
- After being on call, it is encouraged to take time off. Being available for issues and outages will wear you off even if you had no pages, and resting is critical for proper functioning. Just let your team know.

### How to find out who is currently on-call

From Slack you can find out who is oncall by using the slash oncall command( `/oncall` ). The support engineer oncall is listed next to the `CoreOS Customer Support` entry.
