We are going to add an L4 group\(s\). We already have one for quay, so maybe we just create one for CL and one for Tectonic?  We are going to start using two new tags to identify things that are currently 'stuck' where we dont have a clear path forward. I think stuck\_internal and stuck\_external work for this. Thoughts? Should this be done in some other way?   The combination of the stuck tags and L4 groups will be used to manage and message escalations internally.  Current plan is to adjust our ZD plan as EY rolls down to grant engineering access as 'light agents' into ZD.
