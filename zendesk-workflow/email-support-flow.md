#### Email Support Flow

After a ticket has been received it is triaged by a Tier I support staff. The goal of this triage is  to determine the priority level of the issue. An initial email will be sent to ensure that the ticket has been received and reviewed. Issues will be responded according to the per-customer defined SLA.

**Enterprise Support** customers can define the priority level of their issues at will.
