# Welcome! {#docs-internal-guid-2f4c2f73-d84b-4272-0399-79282cd5c4cb}

So you’ve joined the CoreOS team assisting in providing support to customers. First, let us take a moment to say “Thanks!”Every person on the team who is interacting with customers plays a big part in both portraying the company to the outside world and ensuring that the folks giving us money have a positive experience. Kudos!

The primary thing to recognize while doing support is that we are a very different product in our competitive space. Many of our customers may have a humbling moment when moving over from more traditional Linux distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ubuntu. Linux has had an increasing pace of change over the past 20 years and we ride the crest of that wave. As with any technology, there is a learning curve for new users. Our goal should be to simplify that curve and ensure a positive experience for everyone.
